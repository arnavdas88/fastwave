### Build UIs faster, with h2o-wave and fastapi.

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.8+ based on standard Python type hints.

H2O Wave is a software stack for building beautiful, low-latency, realtime, browser-based applications and dashboards entirely in Python/R without using HTML, Javascript, or CSS.

H2O Wave excels at capturing information from multiple sources and broadcasting them live over the web, letting you build and deploy realtime analytics with dramatically less effort.

Combining the best, FastWave provides H2O Wave support in FastAPI.

### Installation
Install the FastWave experience locally with a simple command:
```sh
$ pip install git+https://github.com/arnavdas88/fastwave.git
```

### Usage
Starting with the very basic fastapi server,

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def index():
    return {"description": "The Index Page!!!"}

@app.get("/hello")
async def hello():
    return {"description": "The Hello World Page!!!"}
```

Upgrade your code coolness:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, WebSocket
from h2o_wave import Q
from fastwave import wave, wave_collector

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def index():
    return {"description": "The Index Page!!!"}

@app.get("/hello")
async def hello():
    return {"description": "The Hello World Page!!!"}

@app.get("/ui_1/{title}")
@wave
async def ui_1(title: str, sock: WebSocket, q: Q):
    # ... H2O Wave UI Code ...
    await q.page.save()


@app.get("/ui_2")
@wave
async def ui_2(q: Q):
    # ... H2O Wave UI Code ...
    await q.page.save()

wave_collector(app)
```

And it will render the `ui_1` and `ui_2` in the respective endpoint.

### Structure

A practical FastWave implementation looks like a work of art, with FastAPI and Wave segments elegantly intertwined:

The code schema follows a logical and clean structure:

### How FastWave Works: Behind the Scenes
Wondering what's happening behind the curtain? FastWave orchestrates the magic:

The @wave decorator is the secret sauce. It registers a separate but unique rendering handle to FastAPI, capturing the essence of H2O Wave. It also registers the original H2O Wave handle in a global registry.

When wave_collector is called at the end, it unleashes the magic. It registers all the H2O Wave handles from the global registry to FastAPI, bringing the UIs to life.
